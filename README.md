# Homebridge Feller Wiser plugin

This is a homebridge plugin for the [Wiser-by-Feller](https://wiser.feller.ch/) system based on the provided [api](https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-tutorial). 
When activated it communicates with the wifi-device of the wiser-system to get a list of available loads and provides them as an accessoire in the homebridge system.
